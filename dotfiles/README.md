# Dotfiles
Here's a collection of dot-files I use on my Linux machines!

The majority of these work cross-platform, including docker and WSL, just not any non-posix system.

## Installing
`curl -sSLo- https://github.com/EEKIM10/EEKIM10/raw/master/dotfiles/install.bash | bash`

You can inspect the script you will download here: [install.bash](https://github.com/EEKIM10/EEKIM10/raw/master/dotfiles/install.bash)
