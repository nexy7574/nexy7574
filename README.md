# Hello there

Full about me -> **__[nexy7574.co.uk](https://nexy7574.co.uk)__**

Speed-fire:

Proficient in python 3.6 and above, maintainer of a couple CLI tools and bot frameworks, contributing to many works, full-time cybersecurity & digital forensics (BSc) student in northern England, handy with Python & JavaScript and friends, interest in c-sharp and currently learning golang. Love all things networking, I like seeing computers talking to each other, in the process running too many web servers and running out of ports. Clean, universally formatted code trumps well-documented but ugly code. Permissive licensing on all projects, my code is for all, not a few. Donations discouraged; contributions preferred.

## Contact

There are many ways to contact me. I would prefer if you contacted me using an end-to-end encrypted platform,
however unless you contact me on Matrix, you'll have to get my Signal/WhatsApp details from a different
contact method.
My GPG key is [`0fa334385d0b689f`](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0fa334385d0b689f&fingerprint=on&op=index), and my SSH public key is [here (RSA4096)](https://codeberg.org/nexy7574/.dotfiles/raw/branch/master/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). Only my GPG key is used for signing things, and is renewed annually.
