# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a 17 year old nerd with a special interest in programming and networking. I love playing about with new tools, background automation, QoL utility tools
(see: [my CLI](//github.com/nexy7574/cli-utils)), and writing stupid APIs and other low-effort-and-low-quality programs.

### My past work
Occasionally, I do write good code, such as the [matrix bot framework 'NioBot'](//github.com/nexy7574/niobot), and I wrote the original 
[YourApps](https://web.archive.org/web/20220126234325/https://top.gg/bot/619328560141697036) discord bot (which at its peak had around 2000 guilds).

## Contact Me

You can contact me [on matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:nexy7574.co.uk).

If you can't figure out Matrix, don't worry, you can ask me for other forms of communication via email, however expect several month long
response times, as I don't use email ever. You can send an email to any email address whatseover, so long as it ends in my domain: nexy7574.co.uk
(I will not list one you can send to in order to avoid being scraped. Just trust that there's a wildcard mailbox).

<detail>
<summary>You can only message me on end-to-end apps</summary>
If you cannot use Matrix, I will likely give you either my phone number for Signal/iMessage, or my Session ID.
Unless I know you personally (in which case you aren't going to be asking for my contact details), we won't be communicating without end to end encryption.
And no, I do not accept the zucc'd end to end encryption in whatsapp. If you can use whatsapp, you can use Signal.
